<h2>Santa Claus Gets His Wish</h2>

<hr />
<blockquote>

<p>SCENE.&mdash;<i>The interior of</i> <span class="smcap">Santa Claus's</span> <i>home on
Christmas Eve. There is a door on each side of the
stage, and a fireplace at the back.</i> <span class="smcap">Santa Claus's</span> <i>big
easy-chair is near the front of the stage at the left, and
near the front at the right is a table</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>As the curtain rises the two</i> <span class="smcap">Imps</span> <i>are seated on the
floor, each with a section of harness, the bells of
which they are industriously polishing</i>.)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">First Imp.</span> You must hurry. It's almost seven
o'clock, and soon it will be time to harness the reindeer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Imp.</span> I am hurrying as fast as I can. I shall
get through now before you do, and my bells will be just
as bright as yours. It seems to me that the more I
shine them the sweeter their tone is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Imp.</span> I am polishing mine so bright that when
Santa Claus drives through the sky all the people will
look up and think they see stars twinkling overhead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Imp.</span> And I make my bells so bright that
when they chime the children will hear them in their
sleep and dream they are listening to birds singing in the
springtime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Imp</span> (<i>scornfully</i>). What nonsense! How many
children to-night do you suppose are dreaming of birds
and springtime?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Imp.</span> Why shouldn't they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Imp.</span> Why should they,&mdash;when there are so
many other things to dream of at Christmas time? If
you don't believe me, we'll leave it to Santa Claus. Here
he comes now. Hooray!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> <i>enters from</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span> <i>of stage the</i> <span class="smcap">Imps</span>
<i>run to meet him, and holding an end of the harness
in each hand form a ring and dance around him in
time to the jingling of the bells</i>.)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Hold on! Hold on there! When a
fellow gets to be my age his head isn't steady enough to
stand any such merry-go-'round as this. Come on now,
let's see if you've done your work properly and polished
the bells as I told you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>He sits down in his big armchair and the</i> <span class="smcap">Imps</span> <i>climb
upon his lap</i>.)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">First Imp.</span> I said I would make my bells so bright
that people would think they were twinkling stars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Imp.</span> And <i>I</i> said&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Imp</span> (<i>interrupting</i>). Never mind what <i>you</i>
said. There wasn't any sense to that. Santa Claus,
tell us, what do children dream about at Christmas time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> What do children dream about? Why,
they dream about me, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Both Imps</span> (<i>each shaking a finger at him</i>). O-ho!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> There! I suppose you think I'm a
conceited old chap, but if you don't believe me we'll ask
the Sand-Man. (<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Sand-Man</span> <i>enters</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span> <i>door, carrying
a big bag over his shoulder, and a small bag in his
hand</i>.) Just starting off on your rounds, I see. Have
you a heavy load to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sand-Man.</span> The sand-bag is heavy, but the dream-bag
is light. There isn't much to a dream, you know;&mdash;just
a whiff of fairy powder wrapped up in a bit of mist.
But they do the trick all the same,&mdash;and how the children
love them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> And what are these dreams which the
children love? Are any of them about me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sand-Man.</span> Why, no, Santa. Of course they <i>used</i>
to be, but times have changed, you see. Children nowadays
have so many interests.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> But I thought perhaps just at Christmas
time&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sand-Man.</span> Yes, I know, I know. Yet, after all,
dreams are really a matter of habit. It's the things which
the children enjoy all through the year that stay in their
minds after they fall asleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Well, what are these things which the
children enjoy all the year and dream about every night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sand-Man.</span> Ah! That would be telling. Mustn't
give away the secrets of the trade, you know. Well,
I'm off. See you later.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Exit</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> <i>door</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> (<i>to the</i> <span class="smcap">Imps</span>). Run out with him, boys,
and help him down the steps with his bags. (<i>Exeunt</i>
<span class="smcap">Imps</span>.) H'm! I didn't find out what I wanted to, did
I? I wish I could, though (<i>Yawning.</i>), I wish I could;
but what's the old saying: "If wishes were horses, beggars
might ride"? Holloa! Who's this coming? (<i>The</i>
<span class="smcap">Wish-Bone</span> <i>enters</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> <i>door</i>.) How strangely he walks,&mdash;must
be kind o' stiff in his joints, or else he hasn't any
joints at all. Good-evening, friend, who might you be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wish-Bone</span> (<i>in a melancholy tone</i>). My name is
Wish-Bone. I am all that's left of the Thanksgiving
turkey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> (<i>sympathetically</i>). I say, now, that's
rather a lonely fate for you; but cheer up, it might be
worse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wish-Bone</span> (<i>in the same melancholy tone</i>). It will
be worse. I expect to be laid up with a broken leg most
any day now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Broken leg? Why, bless my stars, man,
what makes you expect anything like that to happen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wish-Bone.</span> It always happens to us wish-bones;
runs in the family. Sometimes it's both legs that are
broken, and the head flies off; and that's the greatest
pity of all, for then there isn't any one gets their wish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Is your business something like mine,
then; giving people whatever they wish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wish-Bone.</span> N-no,-not exactly <i>giving</i> it,&mdash;just
promising it. But it all amounts to the same thing.
Once make people believe they'll get what they wish for,
and somehow it always comes in the end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Then perhaps you can help me out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
My great wish just at present is to know what the children
are dreaming about to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wish-Bone.</span> Sorry to refuse you, but I'm not ready
for business yet. Don't feel quite equal to it. Wait
until I get a little more snap in me, and then I'll call
around again. Good-night.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Wish-Bone</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> <i>door</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> He's about the gloomiest creature I
ever saw; and yet he struck sort of a hopeful note when
he said people would get what they wished for if they
only believed it. I wonder how that would work out in
my case. (<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Sand-Man</span> <i>enters</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> <i>door</i>.) Ah! here
comes the Sand-Man back again. Well, how did things
go with you to-night? Is your sand-bag empty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sand-Man.</span> Almost. It takes a powerful lot of sand
to make the children sleepy the night before Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> And are the dreams all gone too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sand-Man.</span> Not quite. There was one little girl who
refused to go to bed at all, because she is so anxious to
see Santa Claus when he comes. I had two nice dreams
picked out for her but I couldn't use them. Well, my
evening's work is over. (<i>Dropping his bags on the
table.</i>) I suppose you'll be starting soon now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Pretty soon. But what you told me
about that little girl has put me on my guard. It would
never do to let her see me while I am filling her stocking.
So I think I'll sit down by the fire and wait for a few
minutes. She won't be able to keep awake very long.
If you see my Imps around anywhere, send them along
in here. Lazy little scamps! It's time they were helping
me to pack up the toys. (<i>As the</i> <span class="smcap">Sand-Man</span> <i>goes
out</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span> <i>door</i>, <span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> <i>draws his chair up to the
fireplace, where he sits musing with his eyes half-closed;
yawning</i>.) I&mdash;wish&mdash;I&mdash;could&mdash;know&mdash;what the children
are dreaming about to-night.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>The two</i> <span class="smcap">Imps</span> <i>enter</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span> <i>door, and tiptoe forward cautiously</i>.)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">First Imp</span> (<i>whispers</i>). Is Santa Claus asleep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Imp.</span> No, he's only thinking. But we could
make him go to sleep if we wanted to. Here's the Sand-Man's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>bag, and it isn't quite empty. Wouldn't it be fun
to drop some sand in Santa's eyes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Imp.</span> Hush! He'll hear you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>They creep up behind</i> <span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> <i>and toss the sand
in his face. He yawns again.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Imp.</span> I think he's almost asleep now. Here
are two dreams in the dream-bag. Let's open them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Imp.</span> Look out there, clumsy, you're spilling
them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Imp.</span> They were so light I couldn't help it.
The fairy powder is flying all around the room. It's
filling the air so that I can't see. Are you afraid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Imp.</span> Of course not. There's nothing to be
afraid of. Listen! Some one is coming.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>As the light grows dim, soft, slow music is heard,
and the</i> <span class="smcap">Lollipop</span> <i>appears at the</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> <i>of the stage and
moves slowly across to the</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">L.</span>, <i>in time to the music.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Imp</span> (<i>whispering</i>). That looks like one of
those red-headed lollipops that Santa Claus made to put
in the children's stockings. Do you s'pose that one has
escaped from the box?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Imp.</span> I don't think it's a real lollipop. Maybe
it's only a dream. See! It's vanishing away.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Lollipop</span> <i>disappears.</i> <span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> <i>stirs in his
sleep, while the music, slightly louder, changes to a
livelier tune. The</i> <span class="smcap">Ice-Cream Cone</span> <i>enters through
the</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> <i>door and crosses the stage dancing a jig.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Imp.</span> Oh, how funny! What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Imp.</span> That is an ice-cream cone. All children
love to eat them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Imp.</span> Why, I could make one of those. If I
took a tin trumpet from Santa Claus's toy-shop and piled
it full of snow 'twould be just the same thing, wouldn't
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Imp.</span> No&mdash;for even if you were to eat the snow
all up, the tin trumpet would still be left in your hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
But there's never anything left of an ice-cream cone.
Didn't you notice how quickly this one went, almost as
soon as it came?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Imp.</span> But that is because it was only a dream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Imp.</span> That hasn't anything to do with it. A
real ice-cream cone wouldn't have lasted much longer.
Sh! Who's coming now? (<i>As the</i> <span class="smcap">Ice-Cream Cone</span>
<i>disappears the music stops, and the light grows bright
again. The</i> <span class="smcap">Little Girl</span> <i>enters at the</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> <i>She is wrapped
in a muffler and carries a lighted lantern. Coming toward
the front of the stage she stops in terror on seeing
the</i> <span class="smcap">Imps</span>.) Don't be frightened, little girl. We're only
Santa Claus's imps. We won't hurt you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Girl.</span> Then this really is where Santa Claus
lives, and I didn't make a mistake in the place? Please
tell me, is Santa Claus at home? Oh, there he is asleep
by the fire. (<i>She puts her lantern on the floor and goes
up to</i> <span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span>.) Santa Claus! Dear Santa Claus!
Please wake up. It's getting very late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> (<i>rubbing his eyes</i>). Why, bless my
soul! I must have been napping. And who are you,
my dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Girl.</span> I'm the little girl who wouldn't go to
bed to-night, for I wanted to sit up to see Santa Claus.
But I waited and waited, and you didn't come. Oh,
Santa Claus, don't say that you're not coming at all.
The children would be <i>so</i> disappointed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> The children are happy. They are
having sweet dreams. Ah! I know now what they're
dreaming about. Lollipops and ice-cream cones. They're
not thinking much about poor old Santa Claus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Girl.</span> Oh, but Santa Claus, we do think about
you very often. We love you much more than we do
the lollipops and the ice-cream cones, for they just melt
away and don't last at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> And what makes you think that I
would last any longer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Girl.</span> Well, you know, Santa, you've already
lasted a great many years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Kind of a slam on my age, that is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
But it's true, every word of it. I have lasted a great many
years, and the best part of it is, I'm good for as many
years more. So if the children are expecting me, we'd
better hurry and be off. (<i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">Imps</span>.) Bring along
your harness there, boys; it's time to hitch up the reindeer.
Wrap your muffler around you tight, little girl.
We're going to have a cold ride. Here, isn't this your
lantern?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Girl.</span> I shan't need the light of the lantern
now, for the bells on your harness are so bright they shine
like stars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Imp.</span> That's exactly what I said when I was
cleaning them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Imp.</span> And I said that their tones were so clear
that the children would believe they were the birds singing
in the springtime. I was right too, wasn't I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Girl.</span> No, you foolish Imp. When the children
hear Santa Claus's sleigh-bells ringing they will
smile in their sleep and think that they are listening to
the music of the Christmas carols.</p>

<h2>THE CONJURER</h2>

<p class="center">A Dramatic Mystery in Three Acts</p>

<p class="center"><i>By Mansfield Scott</i><br />

<i>Author of "The Submarine Shell," "The Air-Spy," etc.</i></p>


<p>Eight male, four female characters. Costumes, modern; scenery, two
easy interiors. Plays a full evening. Royalty for amateur performance,
$10.00 for the first and $5.00 each for subsequent performances by the
same company. Free for school performance. George Clifford, incapacitated
for service at the front, employs his great talents as a conjurer
to raise money for the soldiers. He is utilized by Inspector Steele, of the
U. S. Secret Service, in a plan to discover certain foreign spies. The plan
goes wrong and involves seven persons in suspicion of a serious crime.
Clifford's clever unravelling of this tangled skein constitutes the thrilling
plot of this play, the interest of which is curiously like that of the popular
"Thirteenth Chair." This is not a "war-play" save in a very remote
and indirect way, but a clever detective story of absorbing interest.
Strongly recommended.</p>

<h2>THE OTHER VOICE</h2>

<p class="center">A Play in One Act</p>

<p class="center"><i>By S.</i> vK. <i>Fairbanks</i></p>


<p>Three voices, preferably male, are employed in this little novelty which
is intended to be presented upon a dark stage upon which nothing is
actually visible save starlight. It was originally produced at Workshop
47, Cambridge, where its effective distillation of the essential oil of tragedy
was curiously successful. An admirable item for any programme seeking
variety of material and effect. Naturally no costumes nor scenery are required,
save a drop carrying stars and possibly a city sky-line. Plays ten
minutes only; royalty, $5.00.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Price, 25 cents</i></p>

<h2>A COUPLE OF MILLION</h2>

<p class="center">An American Comedy in Four Acts</p>

<p class="center"><i>By Walter Ben Hare</i><br />

Author of "Professor Pepp," "Much Ado About Betty,"
"The Hoodoo," "The Dutch Detective," etc.</p>


<p>Six males, five females. Costumes, modern; scenery, two interiors
and an exterior. Plays a full evening. Royalty, ten dollars ($10.00) for
each performance. A more ambitious play by this popular author in the
same successful vein as his previous offerings. Bemis Bennington is left
two million dollars by his uncle on condition that he shall live for one
year in a town of less than five thousand inhabitants and during that
period marry and earn without other assistance than his own industry and
ability the sum of five thousand dollars. Failing to accomplish this the
money goes to one Professor Noah Jabb. This is done despite the energetic
opposition of Jabb, who puts up a very interesting fight. A capital play
that can be strongly recommended. Plenty of good comedy and a great
variety of good parts, full of opportunity.</p>

<p>Two male, one female characters. Costumes, modern; scene, an interior.

admirable little travesty of the conventional emotional recipe calling for

<h2>NO TRESPASSING</h2>

<p class="center"><i>By Evelyn Gray Whiting</i></p>


<p>Six males, five females. Costumes, modern; scenery, a single easy interior.
Plays two hours. Free of royalty. Lisle Irving, a lively "city
girl," goes down into the country on a vacation and to get rid of a husband
of her father's choice whom she has never seen, and runs into the
very man living there under another name. He meets her by accident
and takes her to be one of a pair of twins who have been living at the
farmhouse. She discovers his mistake and in the character of both twins
in alternation gives him the time of his life, incidentally falling in love
with him. An unusual abundance of good comedy characters, including
one&mdash;Bill Meader&mdash;of great originality and humor, sure to make a big
hit. Strongly recommended.</p>

hour. Daisy Jordan, crazy to get "on the stage," comes to New York
and starves there in a lodging house waiting for her chance. She schemes
to get an interview with Cicely Denver, a popular actress, to act before

<p>Eleven female characters. Costumes, modern; scenery, an interior.
Plays an hour and a quarter. Hitty, a patriotic spinster, quite alone in
the world, nevertheless hangs up a service flag in her window without
any right to do so, and opens a Tea Room for the benefit of the Red
Cross. She gives shelter to Stella Hassy under circumstances that close
other doors against her, and offers refuge to Marjorie Winslow and her
little daughter, whose father in France finally gives her the right to the
flag. A strong dramatic presentation of a lovable character and an ideal
patriotism. Strongly recommended, especially for women's clubs.</p>

<p>Nine female characters. Costumes, modern; scenery, an interior.
Plays half an hour. Eleanor will not forego luxuries nor in other ways
"do her bit," putting herself before her country; but when her old
enemy, Jane Rivers, comes to the Knitting Club straight from France to
tell the story of her experiences, she is moved to forget her quarrel and
leads them all in her sacrifices to the cause. An admirably stimulating
piece, ending with a "melting pot" to which the audience may also be
asked to contribute. Urged as a decided novelty in patriotic plays.</p>

the Secret Service, finally locates the offender amid a maze of false clues,
in the person of a washerwoman who hangs out her clothes day after day in
ways and places to give the desired information. A capital play, well
recommended.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
